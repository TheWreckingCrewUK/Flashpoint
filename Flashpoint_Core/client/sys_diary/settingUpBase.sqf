	"1. As a Group Leader ACE interact on the infoStand then click on the map where you wish to place the base<br/>
	2. Now walk exactly where you want respawn West to be and self interact (Base >> Set Respawn)<br/>
	3. Walk where you wish the ammobox to be deployed then self interace (Base >> Set AmmoBox)<br/>
	4. Walk to where you want the ground vehicles to be deployed then self interact (Base >> Vehicle Spawn)<br/>
	5. Walk to where you want the helicopters to deploy and self interact (base >> Helicopter Spawn)<br/>
	6. When satisfied finalize the base with self interact (base >> finalize). This optiopn won't appear until all parts are made. It works by checking if the stuff is within 200m so if it doesn't show your stuff might be too far away form you<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	If you are unhappy with this location self interace (base >> restart)"
